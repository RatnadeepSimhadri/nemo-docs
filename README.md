# Welcome to Nemo

Nemo is a framework and set of conventions for automated testing of web and even native applications. How you use it is only limited by your imagination. A common starting point is to pair Nemo with a task runner (e.g. Grunt) and a test runner (e.g. Mocha). But if you have a different task and test runner, Nemo will work with that as well.

## Meet the players

The following modules are essential for getting started with Nemo

### [generator-nemo](https://github.com/paypal/generator-nemo)
To get everything off the ground quickly, start here.

### [nemo](https://github.com/paypal/nemo)

Nemo lovingly hugs selenium-webdriver, bundles up the plugins of your choice, and gives it all back to you in a single namespace for your testing pleasure.

### [nemo-view](https://github.com/paypal/nemo-view)

Nemo view replaces nemo's built-in "view" functionality with a much cooler interface. Use it in concert with nemo-drivex and nemo-locatex.

## [Try the sample app](https://github.com/paypal/nemo-example-app)

Follow the README instructions to get the sample app installed and run Nemo tests.

## Install Nemo from scratch

The best way to explore all the moving parts (in our opinion) is to get your hands dirty. [It won't take long, give it a shot](grunt-mocha.md).
